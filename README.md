# Kernel-Functions-and-its-applications

In this project different kernel funtions like linear, polynomial, Radial basis function(RBF), Laplacian, Sigmod are implemented without using any inbuilt library and
study the importance of using and not using these kernel in applications like Classification using Support Vector Machine and Principle Component Analysis.
